Over the years, I've tried many different flavors of personal website,
from LiveJournal to Wordpress to lovingly hand-crafted HTML to my own
weirdo hand-rolled "convert markdown to HTML using a Makefile and some
shell scripts" solution. ~~Seems like GitHub pages are the latest craze,
so I thought I'd give it a whirl and see what happens.~~

**Update:** Yeah, that was fun. GitHub pages are all fine and dandy
but I can just as easily roll my own. Jekyll generates a static
website--so it doesn't really matter whether I use GitHub pages or
just upload it to the S3 bucket I've been using for eons via a GitHub
workflow.
