Over the years, I've tried many different flavors of personal website,
from LiveJournal to Wordpress to lovingly hand-crafted HTML to my own
weirdo hand-rolled "convert markdown to HTML using a Makefile and some
shell scripts" solution. Seems like GitHub pages are the latest craze,
so I thought I'd give it a whirl and see what happens.
