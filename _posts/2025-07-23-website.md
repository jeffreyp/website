For somebody who posts once or twice per year, I've spent an
inordinate amount of my time setting up this website:

* I have no interest in running my own Wordpress instance or anything
  like that so I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* In the rare case when I write a new post (like today!), it gets
  checked into a [Github
  repository](https://github.com/jeffreyp/website).
* The Github repo contains an action that uploads the website content
  to an S3 bucket upon every commit.
* The domain is registered in Route53 and configured to serve static
  content from said S3 bucket. No webserver required.
* In close partnership with my dear friend and always reliable intern
  [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), I created my
  own [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jeffreyp/lord-stanley) that I
  can modify however/whenever I want.
* I use the lovely [Jekyll Remote
  Theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) plugin to
  avoid the hassle of creating gemfiles. 
  

I also do most of my hacking on my iPad. I use the free
[Terminus](https://termius.com/index.html) app to ssh into an EC2
instance where I can pull/push to/from Github, and the free version of
the app supports port forwarding so I can test changes on the iPadOS
Safari. It works fine for the vast majority of changes--the only time
I need to use a "real" computer are those unusual occasions when I
need access to the browser console.
