![image me](/assets/images/me.jpg)

I live in West Seattle with my wife, two children, and two cats. I am
  a lifelong Seattleite, and [some of my ancestors were in Seattle in
  the late 1880's](http://jeffreypratt.org/2024/05/20/family-history.html). The roots run deep! I like to travel and see new
  things/meet new people, but returning home is always a delight
  (especially on an airplane with the stellar views of mountains and
  water).
  
I am the 100th longest tenured active employee at Amazon.com (as of
  September 11, 2023). This factoid isn't all that impressive to me,
  since I have good friends who are in the top 10. But for some
  reason, it interests people, so I'll share it. Maybe someday I'll write
  something about all the myriad ways in which Amazon has changed
  since March 8, 1999.
  
I love food--I enjoy cooking, BBQing, smoking, frying, sous vide'ing,
  blanching, steaming, microwaving, all of it. I'll never be a chef,
  but I still enjoy the process.
